<h1>Output of TalkBack</h1>
<h2>Native Apps</h2>
<p>
    You may have noticed that the heading "Heading Structure", unlike the following two headings, has been announced by TalkBack as "Heading Heading Structure" only. This is not a duplication of the word "heading" by the screen reader, but a text formatted as a heading on a non-visual level.
</p>
<h2>HTML content</h2>
<p>
    For HTML documents, for example, TalkBack says "HTML content heading 2". Since it is a heading of the second heading level (h2). No matter whether an HTML document is called up in a browser or integrated into an app, TalkBack always says the headings in the same way.
