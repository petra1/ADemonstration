<h1>Output of TalkBack</h1>
<h2>Native Apps</h2>
<p>
    You may have already noticed that the heading "Heading Structure", unlike the following two
    headings, was only announced as "Heading Heading Structure" by TalkBack. This is not a
    duplication of the word "Heading" by the screen reader, but a text that has been marked as a
    heading on a non-visual level.
</p>
<h2>HTML content</h2>
<p>
    For HTML documents, Talkback says, for example, "HTML Content Heading 2". Since this is a
    heading of the second heading level (h2). It does not matter whether an HTML document is called
    up in a browser or integrated in an app, TalkBack always announces the headings in the same way.
