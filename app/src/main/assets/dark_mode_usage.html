    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>
        The app is intended to give you your first hand-on experience with accessibility on Android devices and especially with TalkBack, the screen reader integrated in Android. It does not matter whether you are an Android developer yourself or not. The app can also be used in a training course for Accessibility specialists or as an evaluation tool for automated accessibility testing frameworks.
        If you an Android developer your can find the GitHub repository for the app here https://github.com/petra1/ADemonstration/tree/Lokalisation_de
        To be able to use the app meaningfully, you must activate the screen reader Talkback (or VoiceAssistant on older Samsung devices).
    </p>

    <h2>Activation of the screen reader:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Settings</li>
        <li>Scroll down to Accessibility and open it</li>
        <li>Scroll to TalkBack and open it</li>
        <li>Activate Talkback with the button next to "Use TalkBack"</li>
        <li> Give TalkBack the permissions if it asked</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you do not have any experience with Talkback, it is advisable to work through the introduction that appears when you start TalkBack for the first time.
    </p>

    <h2>General layout of the screens</h2>
    <p>
        On each screen there are typical elements that are often used in Android apps (e.g., input fields, graphics, graphical buttons, etc.). The upper of the two has been implemented without accessibility in mind on the lower to accessibility has been play attention. If you go through the examples with talkback, you can see or hear the difference between the two examples.
