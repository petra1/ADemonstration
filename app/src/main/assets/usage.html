    <h1>Usage</h1>
    <p>
        The app is designed to give you your first practical experience with accessibility on Android devices, especially with TalkBack, the screen reader built into Android. It does not matter whether you are an Android developer yourself or not. The app can also be used in a training course for accessibility specialists or as an evaluation tool for automated accessibility testing frameworks.

    </p>
    <p>
        To use the app in a meaningful way, you need to activate the TalkBack screen reader (or VoiceAssistant on older Samsung devices).
    </p>

    <h2>Activate the screen reader:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open Settings</li>
        <li>Scroll down to Accessibility and open it.</li>
        <li>Scroll to TalkBack and open it</li>
        <li>Activate TalkBack with the button next to "Use TalkBack".</li>
        <li>Give TalkBack the permissions it requires</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
        If you do not have any experience with Talkback, it is advisable to work through the introduction that appears when you start TalkBack for the first time.
    </p>

    <h2>General layout of the screens</h2>
    <p>
        On each screen there are typical elements that are often used in Android apps (e. g. input fields, graphics, graphical buttons, etc.). The upper of the two elements was implemented without regard to accessibility, while the lower element was implemented with accessibility in mind. If you go through the examples with TalkBack, you can experience the difference between the two examples.
