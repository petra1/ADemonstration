    <!--Contrast ratio-->
    <string name="contrast_description">The contrast ratio is often not given enough attention in the development of mobile apps. However, especially in mobile use, a good contrast ratio is important for all users, e.g. when using mobile devices outdoors in sunshine. Below you will find some examples of good and bad contrast ratios.</string>
    <string name="passed">Passed with 21.0:1, HEX: #ffffff on #000000.</string>

    <string name="no_alt_description">In this example, the alternative text was intentionally omitted. In practice, it happens very often that the alternative text is omitted by mistake.</string>
    <string name="decorative_graphics">Decorative Graphics</string>
    <string name="deco_graphic_description">In this example, the graphic was assumed to be purely decorative and the alternative text was left blank so that TalkBack ignores the graphic and does not output unnecessary text.</string>
    <string name="informative_graphic">Informative Graphic</string>
    <string name="informative_graphic_description">In this example, the graphic was assumed to be informative, so it was provided with an alternative text.</string>

    <string name="Description2_imageButton">In the first graphical button, the alternative text was intentionally omitted and the target was not adjusted. The second graphic button, on the other hand, has been labelled correctly and the touch target has been adjusted  so that the button is displayed larger and is therefore easier to use.</string>
